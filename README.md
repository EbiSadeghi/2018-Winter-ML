## UBC Scientific Software Seminar

The UBC Scientific Software Seminar brings together students, graduates, fellows and faculty at UBC to develop software skills for science.

### Winter 2018 Machine Learning: Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn & Tensorflow

[Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn & Tensorflow](https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml) is a beautiful book written by [Aur√©lien Geron](https://github.com/ageron) and includes a series of Jupyer notebooks for each chapter. Our goal is to work through as many notebooks as we can. *Everyone is invited!*

#### LEARNING GOALS

* To master [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/) for machine learning
* To learn the basics of [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) for constructing and training neural networks

#### SCHEDULE

Our machine learning seminar meets every **Friday 1-2pm in LSK 121**. Please join the [UBCS3 mailing list](https://ubc.ca1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_6VCa1EYL5xjlUQ5) to receive weekly updates about the seminar.
